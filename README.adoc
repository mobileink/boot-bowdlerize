= boot-bowdlerize

Thomas Bowdler infamously excised the naughty bits in Shakespeare,
producing a sanitized -- _bowdlerized_ -- version of the Bard for
children and the those whose sensibilities were offended by obscene
language.  `boot-bowdlerize` tries to do the same for `bower`,
excising those nasty bits bits of Javascript and JSON to produce a
Clojurized version suitable for those offended by obscene languages.
